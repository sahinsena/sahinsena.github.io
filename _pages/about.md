Hello! Thanks for checking in! Since you’re already here, don’t be shy—drop a quick hello before you go! :)

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy, and I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Frank Li. My research focuses on how cybersecurity guidance is interpreted and operationalized in real-world environments—bridging the gap between what is secure in theory and what is practiced. I employ an interdisciplinary approach, combining empirical methods, human-centered design, and technical evaluation to enhance security standards and assurance in areas like critical infrastructure, industrial supply chains, authentication systems, and accountable AI in security-critical workflows.
